Editable theses for use as templates:

*   [S. B. Thesis in Microsoft Word Format (DOC - 27MB)](/ans7870/22/22.THT/f15/MIT22_THTF15_assn_sb.docx)  
    Professor Short's S. B. thesis, 2005. Use this as a template if you choose to use MSWord.
*   [PhD Thesis in LyX Format (ZIP - 45MB)](/ans7870/22/22.THT/f15/assn_phd_lyx.zip) (The ZIP file contains: 8 .aux files, 1 .bak file, 2 .bbl files, 1 .bib file, 1 .cls file, 1 .layout file, 2 .lof files, 16 .lyx files, 1 .lyx~ file, 2 .performance monitor files, 1 .sty file, 17 .tex files, 3 text document files, 2 .toc files, 2 .pdf files, 135 .jpeg files, 128 .png files.)  
    Professor Short's PhD thesis, from 2010. Use this as a template for LyX, and export it to LaTeX if you so desire. MIT style files are included.

Useful Technical Writing Tools
------------------------------

*   [Beall's List of “potential, possible, or probable” predatory open-access publishers 2015](http://scholarlyoa.com/publishers/)  
    Be wary of using journals on this list in your research. However, don't assume that mere presence on this list constitutes a disreputable journal. Beall's List is a self-maintained site, and there is some debate about its objectiveness and accuracy. See "[Beyond Beall’s List: Better understanding predatory publishers](http://crln.acrl.org/content/76/3/132.full)" and ["Ethics and Access 1: The Sad Case of Jeffrey Beall" (PDF)](http://citesandinsights.info/civ14i4.pdf) for critiques. A case of a publisher being added and later removed after protest is described in [Beall's own blog post](https://publons.com/blog/bealls-list-gone-but-not-lost/) and the [corresponding publisher's notice](http://www.mdpi.com/about/announcements/534). Let's just say that you should consider your sources very carefully, and look for your own warning signs of low quality, predatory publishing practices, or something not sounding right.
*   [LyX](http://www.lyx.org/Download)  
    Use this graphical front-end to LaTeX as a happy compromise between Word's ease of use and LaTeX's robustness.
*   [LaTeX Tutorial](http://www.latex-tutorial.com/)  
    A site to easily help you learn LaTeX for scientific writing.
*   [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/)  
    Use this collaborative, cloud-based LaTeX editor to work on your documents in real-time with your advisor.
*   [JabRef](http://www.jabref.org/)  
    A lightweight BiBTeX reference manager that integrates seamlessly with LaTeX and LyX.
*   [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/)  
    A tool to organize and annotate PDFs and export citations.
*   [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)  
    A tool to find, organize, and cite bibliographic references.
